**GHPM** is a package manager for GitHub, it effectively manages coding projects, applications, and anything else code-able! **GHPM** does not use any highly advanced coding techniques, much the opposite in fact. it uses basic, straight-forward logic, it is the lack of complication that makes this project the most light-weight Manager available. Not only that, it is the first manager to allow for **Launching** of programs rather than solely installing them.
