## Syslogs

GHPM has an internal logger that saves logs to 
`GitHub-Package Manager/System/Cache/System/ErrorLog/Events`

If there is an error that is occurring there is a potential that it is due to an issue that occurred in a different function but was only raised at a later point. -The log files should give insight as to where the error was originally raised.

### How-To

 1. For most, it will be easiest to navigate to **Command Line Version** within the UI.
 2. Withing the Command Line, navigate to **Manual Cache Management** then select option **4** or **Display Logs / Events**
 3. Once this has returned the information, simply copy and paste it down here. 
   `enter logfile here`

 **!make sure to remove any file paths that contain names or sensitive information!**
